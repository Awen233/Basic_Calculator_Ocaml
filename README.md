# Basic_Calculator_Ocaml
this is the basic calculator, implemented by Ocaml, to run this code,
just do:

ocamlc -o test bc.ml 
then:
./test

ocaml should run:

to use the test cases:
plastic the test cases to the bottom of the code, then run recompile and run again. each testcase should give different output.

the correct results are among the output. 
I call printScope statement at the last to display the whole scope to the console. 

I will try to add more testcases later. 

Thanks~
